# Quadratic Equation
# Have the user enter in the coefficients of a quadratic equation in the
# format: ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and calculate the solutions of the equation
# rounded to 2 decimal places. Use a try...except block to catch if there
# is no solution
# incorporate a while loop to keep having the user enter in values for a,b,c
# until they are valid
# incorporate a second while loop to keep repeating the program without
# having to rerun it.

""" Sample output:
Enter in the coefficients for a quadratic equation in the format:
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0
a:3
b:d
c:1
Those are not valid values for a, b or c
a:3
b:2
c:1
There are no real roots to the equation
a:2
b:-3
c:-6
The roots are 2.64 and -1.14
a:1
b:8
c:16
The roots are -4.0 and -4.0
